# My portfolio page
This is a small webapp to provide a place for info about myself and my projects, and also a playground where I mess around with web development and JavaScript!

## Currently using:
- functional React with React Hooks
- Node.js with Yarn
- Styled Components

## Future Plans:
- better styling (bootstrap? material UI?)
- add analytics
