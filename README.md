# My portfolio page
This is a small webapp to provide a central place for info about myself and my projects, and also a playground where I mess around with web development and JavaScript!

## Currently using:
- React
- Node.js with npm
- CSS

## Future Plans:
- convert to functional React
- styled components instead of a CSS file
- introduce Redux for state
- migrate to yarn instead of npm
- add analytics
